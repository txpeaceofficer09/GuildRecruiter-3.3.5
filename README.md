The addon joins the World channel and sends messages at the specified interval. (Default 30 seconds)

Slash commands (/gr /grecruit /guildrecruiter):

* msg {message} - Set the recruitment message. (Without the message parameter, it just prints the current guild message)
* toggle - Turn the auto-announce on/off.
* timer {seconds} - Set the delay between messages.

In the message, \_GUILD_ is replaced by the name of your guild.
